# Book Genre Classifier

This book genre classifier serves as a way to classify books by genres based on the summary of each book using natural language processing models.

There are many different types of genres, and a book has the potential to fall under many of these genres since some genres are incredibly similar and sometimes indistinguishable. With this in mind, the task of labeling books as a certain genre is nontrivial, which is something we aim to solve using text classification executed by this NLP book genre classifier. 

The book genre classifier uses text classification to determine the genre of a book based purely off of its summary. In order to do so, it uses multiple machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest to see which model will work best for our specific needs. 

This project was driven by the overarching question:is it possible to classify books by their genres based purely off of their summaries in an accurate manner? After creating, training, and testing our models, our results showed us that it is definitely possible and can be done with reasonable accuracy.
